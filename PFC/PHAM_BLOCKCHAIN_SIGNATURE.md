## Technical Summary

**PFC Engine** is a working memory + action selection + inhibition engine.

### Core Algorithms

1. **Working Memory**: Miller's Law (7±2 capacity), time decay
2. **Expected Utility**: U = reward - cost - risk × κ
3. **Softmax Selection**: P(i) = exp(β × U_i) / Σ exp(β × U_j)
4. **Inhibition Gate**: Go/No-Go based on conflict signal
